# Raspberry LCD Monitor
Raspberry pi monitor to use with Adafruit LCD Plate.

This is a simple project I made to handle basic tasks from a Raspberry without the need of an external monitor or ssh. I'm using the Adafruit LCD Plate with 4 direction buttons and 1 select button, although it could work with two buttons only.

It shows system information such as HD and CPU/Memory usage, public/private network IP, upload/download transfer speeds, uptime, torrents jobs state and torrent rx/tx counters.
Also you can perform basic tasks such as rebooting, powering down, turning ssh on/off, limiting torrents, stopping/resuming them, etc.
